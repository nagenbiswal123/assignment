rm -r filename    ===>if file not empty we can do this command for delete this file

rm command can work for any directory whether it is empty or not
rmdir can work only to remove empty directories


to remove multiple file one file inside another then also -r is not required

Q.what is te difference between usage of > and >> with cat command

> meant for overwritting of existing data
>> meant for appending new data to existing data


Q. If we are using touch command to create 3file, but the file is already there with some content then what will happend?
   1.error
   2.the old data will be removed so that file will become empty
   3.Nothing will be happened to the file but timestamp will be changed.
   

  -rw-rw-r-- 1 nagenbiswal nagenbiswal 92 Aug 16 14:30 file1.txt
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 nagenbiswal nagenbiswal 92 Aug 16 14:43 file1.txt
   1.To create an empty stamp
   2.To change timestamp of an existing file


gedit      ====>widows Notepad

gedit file2.txt
then write something
then save ctrl+save
then quit enter ctrl+q


nano file4.txt
ctrl+o  ===>to save
ctrl+x  ===>exit


How to view content of the file:
--------------------------------
we can content of the file by using the following commands:

1.cat  
2.tac
3.rev
4.head
5.tail
6.more
7.less
8.


cat < file1.txt  ====>where less tha is optional 
cat file1.txt   ====>to see the file
cat -n file1.txt ===>To see the  file

while displaying data if we want numbers,we have to use -n option
cat -n file1.txt 

Numbering skipped for Blank lines then we should use -b option

To multiple files content simultaneously  



various utilities of cat command:
--------------------------------
1. create a new file word some content
  
 cat > file1.txt
 required data
 ctrl+d   -->to save and exit


2.To append some extra to an existing file:
------------------------------------------
cat >> file1.txt
some more extra data
ctrl+d ---> to save and exit


3.To view content of the file:
-----------------------------
cat < file1.txt  or cat file1.txt

4.To copy content of one file to another file:
---------------------------------------------
cp file1.txt file2.txt
cat file1.txt > file2.txt

5.To append one file content to anopther
---------------------------------------
cat file1.txt >> file2.txt

6.To copy content of multiple files in a single file
-----------------------------------------------------
a.txt b.txt c.txt d.txt > total.txt 

a.txt b.txt c.txt d.txt >> total.txt    Instead of Overwrite


cat is the word derived from con"cat"enation



2.tac command:
-------------
It is reverse of cat .
It will display file content in reverse order of lines.
This is vertical reversal.
unny
BUnny
Vinny
Piunny
Gunny
Bunny
Sambhu

Sambhu
Bunny
Gunny
Piunny
Vinny
BUnny
sunny



3.rev command:
-------------
rev means reversal.
Here each line will be reversed.
It is horizontal reversal.



sdiff command
-------------
we can use sdiff command for side by side comparision(parallel comparision)

It is exactly same as diff with -y option



2 window is their
-----------------

ctrl+w+w  -----> to go next window
:q       ------>To close current window
:qa      ------->To close all windows
:qa!     ------>To close all windows forefully


comm command:
-------------
By using this command we can compare data of two files


vomm file1.txt file2.txt 
Result will be displayed in 3 columns
column-1: Data present in only in file2 but not in file2
column-2: Data present in only in file2 but not in file1
column-3:Common data of both files

with comm command we can use the following options:

-1 ===> If we don't want to display column-1
-2 ===> If we don't want to display column-2
-3 ===> If we don't want to display column-3
-12 ===> If we don't want to display columns 1&2.
-13 ===>We don't want to display column 1&3.


1.hard link:
---------
To create link file ln nagen1.txt nagen1Ln.txt



2.soft link:
-----------
This is just like windows Desktop shortcut
A softlink file is a ponter to another file
It is also known as symbolic link
we can create softlink file by using ln command but with -s option


ln -s original_file_name soft_link_file_name


Important conclusions about softskilnk file:
--------------------------------------------
1Bothe Original file and softlink file have
1. Different inode numbers
2.Difference file sizes
3.Difference time stamps


















Shell scripting
--------------
1.shell is responsible to read command provided by user.
2.shell will check whether the command is valid or not.
3.shell will check whether the command is properly used or not.
4.If everthing is proper then shell interprets(converts) that command into kernal unserstable






Types of shell
------
1.Bourne shell
2.Bash shell ----->>>It sis default shell
3.Korn shell
4.Cshell
5.Tshell
6.Zshell
etc



1.Bourne shell:
--------------
It is developed by Stephen Bourne.
This is first shell which is developed for UNIX.
By using sh command we can access this shell.

Shell Script
------------
It sis nothing buyt it is a file like 
It is a program which contain a group of command

Test.java
test.py
test.sh



vi editor
geditor
nano editor


gedit test.sh
ctrl+s ===>save
ctrl+q  ===>quit

user cannot execute this script
user should has execute permission on this script, then only he can execute that script.

chmod  u+x test2.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nagenbiswal nagenbiswal 42 Aug 19 14:55 test2.sh
 rw- ==>User Permissions
 r-- ==>Group permissions
 r-- ==>Others Persmissions

 sh ./test2.sh   ====>To check the value
 bash ./test2.sh

2.Bash shell
------------
BASH ===>Bourne Again Shell 
It is advanced version of Bournce Shell
This is default shell for most of the linux flavours.
By using bash command we can access this shell.
 

All scripting language are Interpreter 


3. Korn Shell:
-------------
It is developed by David Korn
Mostly this shell used in IBM AIX Operating System.
By Using ksh command, we can access this shell.



4.Cshell:
--------
Developed by Bill Joy.
c meant for California University.
It is also bydefacult available with UNIX.
By using csh command we can access this Cshell.

5.Tshell:
---------
It is advanced vesion of Cshell.
It is most commonly used uin HP UNIX systems.
By using tcsh command, we can access this shell.


6.Zshell:
---------
Developed by Paul.
By ousing zsh command we can access this shell.


The most commonly used shell in linux environment is bash

How to default shell in our system:-
-----------------------------------
echo $0   ----->>To check default shell
echo $SHELL ----->To check Default shell

we can check default shell information inside /etc/passwd file also.

nagenbiswal:x:1000:1000:nagenbiswal,,,:/home/nagenbiswal:/bin/bash


How to check all available shells in our system:
------------------------------------------------

cat /etc/shells   ---->>To check available shell

# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/sh
/bin/dash
/usr/bin/dash


How to switch to other shells:
------------------------------
nagenbiswal@nagenbiswal:~$ echo $0
bash
nagenbiswal@nagenbiswal:~$ sh
$  echo $0
sh
$ exit
nagenbiswal@nagenbiswal:~$ echo $0
bash
nagenbiswal@nagenbiswal:~$ rbash
nagenbiswal@nagenbiswal:~$ echo $0
rbash
nagenbiswal@nagenbiswal:~$ exit
exit
nagenbiswal@nagenbiswal:~$ dash
$  echo $0
dash
$ 


What is shell script:
--------------------
A sequence of commands saved to a file and this is nothing but shell script.

Programming features also: Control statements, loops, functions, array etc


How to write and run First shell script:
----------------------------------------
1)Write script

vi editor
nano editor
geditor: ctrl+s ===>save
         ctrl+q ==>quit

test.sh:
-------
echo "Welcome to shell scripting"
date
cal 



2. User to execute this script. To execute this script compulsory user should has execute permission on this file.

-rw-rw-r-- 1 nagenbiswal nagenbiswal 36 Aug 19 16:55 test.sh

rw-  ==>User/owner permission
r-- ==>Group permission
r-- ==>Others Permissions


Run the script:
--------------
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/bin
/usr/games
/usr/local/games
/snap/bin
/snap/bin

Give the execute permission
---------------------------
$ chmod u+x demo.sh

To run/Execute the script 
-----------------
./demo.sh  or bash ./test.sh   or  sh  ./demo.sh

Importants of sha-Bang:
-----------------------
c#
#  ---->>SHARP
!  ----->>BANG
#!  ----->>Sharp Bang or Sha-Bang or shebang

By using sha-bang,we can specify the interpreter(command) which is responsible to execute the script.


/bin/sh     ./demo.sh



Write a python Script and execute without shabang and with shabang:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

test.sh

test.py
---------
import random
name = input("Enter YOur Name:")
l = ["sunny","MIllika","Veena","Katrina","Deepika","Malika","Aalia"]
print("Hello:", name)
print("Congratulation....... you are going to marry",random.choice(1))


bash  ./test.py

/usr/bin/python3

Q.without shabang:
------------------
$ /usr/bin/python3 ./test.py
$ python3 ./test.py

With shabang:
-------------
$ ./test.py


Q. Consider the following script?


magic.sh:
---------
#! /bin/rm
echo "The current system date and time"
date

How to run our script from anywhere in our system directly:
-----------------------------------------------------------
/home/nagenbiswal/scripts  ===>test.sh

touch ====>PATH Variable Location
echo $PATH
which touch

/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/bin
/usr/games
/usr/local/games
/snap/bin
/snap/bin


For any command or script, bydefault our os will check locations specified by PATH Variable.

If we add our script location to PATH Variable locations, then we can run our script from anywherre


1.session level:
----------------
export PATH=$PATH:/home/nagenbiswal/scripts

2.How to set PATH permanently at user level:
-------------------------------------------
/home/nagenbiswal
   
       .bashrc  file

.bashrc
